# Requirements
## Introduction
 ---This work is derived from https://github.com/CodeSenpii/pacman-console-mode and improved.
 --- Pac-Man is an arcade video game developed by Toru Iwatani and produced by Namco. It is one of the most famous classic video game. Pacman is basically a maze chase video game where, in a classic game, a yellow disc is represented by pacman must consume all the food on its way without colliding with roaming ghosts. The original game contains levels till 256. Here's a mini version of the pacman game where the player has to keep dodging ghosts and navigate in the remaining field.

## Research

---In 1980 the Japanese arcade game manufacturer Namco Limited introduced the world to Pac-Man. Iwatani hoped that Namco could market an arcade game that appealed to females by paying close attention to themes, design, and colours. In contrast to the shooting of space aliens and other enemies that dominated most arcade games at the time, the game design was influenced by food and eating. Instead, players used a joystick to navigate a basic maze, devouring coloured dots until they were all gone, completing a level and moving on to the next maze. Originally this game contained 256 levels of which the last level is unsolveable as there was some error in designing.

## Cost and Features
-- The cost of the project is mostly determined by how much time the developers spend writing code to execute the functions. 
--The financial investment is small.
-- Simple navigation game using keys ";", ",", ".", "/". 
-- Modular Program approach with the ability to quickly add new functions. 
--Easy to input commands and can be used directlyin real world for entertainment purposes.

## Defining Our System
    -- The program contains multiple functions for navigating ghosts and pacman.
    -- usage of if-else, switch, extern, enum etc.
    -- Functions can also be added further to add original pacman like features such as food and make it colourful.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
This is a general SWOT analysis for not only PACMAN, but also all the Video games production around the world.
 -- S :The games industry is growing at a phenomenal pace. Casual games becoming significant in market with many companies dedicated to producing only these simple user friendly nad easily recheable products hence driving significant revenue through various subscription methods.
 -- W :There is not enough talent to supply all of the productions that are going on. There is also a shortage of good project managers who have the ability to wrangle multi-disciplinary teams.
 -- O :There are opportunities in games everywhere around us. At the low-risk end there are plenty of success stories from small studios who focus on casual and classic games like PACMAN. Games like PACMAN are easily reached and enjpyed by people.
 -- T : since forever video games like PACMAN are known for its addiction abilities as they capture the player's attention so quickly. additionally, insurance costs for production of such video games is increasing.
