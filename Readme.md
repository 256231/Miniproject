## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Code coverage - took a long time to run the test
2. Finding alternatives for functions like getch(), kbhit() as they're only included in conio.h prototype
3. Writing test case for ghot2_direction as it returns random value each time

## Learning Resources
